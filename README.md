This repository will hold a series of tools to process and visualize the datasets provided to the public by IMDB.

### Director Filmography
This tool uses a director's full name from the text input to select all directors of feature-length and short films with an exact name match. If there are more than one result, it selects the director with the greatest cumulative number of IMDB rating votes, and returns a scatter plot of the selected director's works. The works are limited to and organized by feature-length and short projects.
